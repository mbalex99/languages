While English has become more and more lax with greetings, French hasn't changed so much. So when traveling around France, it's very important to use greetings appropriately in different times and situations throughout the day. </p>\n<h3>Polite Greetings</h3>\n<p>Use these greetings when meeting people you do not know (or do not know very well), people older than you, </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bonjour</strong> - This literally means \"Good Day\"!</li>\n<li><strong>Bonsoir</strong> - This means \"Good Evening\". Usually used after 4pm or 5pm</li>\n<li><strong>Enchanté(e)</strong> - \"Nice to meet you\". </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Casual Greetings</h3>\n<p>Use these for friends or people you are quite familiar with. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Salut</strong> - \"Hi\" </li>\n<li><strong>Ça va?</strong> – \"How are you?\" This is a short form of \"Comment Ça va?\".</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Goodbyes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Au revoir!</strong> - This is the most common way to say \"Goodbye\" in French. This is <em>formal</em> and should be recommended for most tourism use.</li>\n<li><strong>Salut!</strong> - \"Goodbye\". You may notice, that Salut! is a casual greeting. You can also use this as a \"Goodbye\" as well. </li>\n<li><strong>à bientôt</strong> - \"See you soon\". While it may mean that you are using it to see someone in the near future, it can also be assumed to be used as a general \"Goodbye\" as well.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"December 04, 2019","path":"/french/introduction","title":"Introduction"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
