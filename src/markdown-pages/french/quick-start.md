There's no better way to start off learning French with some very easy phrases. 

## Greetings

Greeting are incredibly important in any language. While English has become more and more lax with greetings, French hasn't changed so much. So when traveling around France, it's very important to use greetings appropriately in different times and situations throughout the day. 

### Polite Greetings 
Use these greetings when meeting people you do not know (or do not know very well), people older than you, 

* **Bonjour** - This literally means "Good Day"!
* **Bonsoir** - This means "Good Evening". Usually used after 4pm or 5pm
* **Enchanté(e)** - "Nice to meet you". 
* **Comment allez-vous?** - "How are you?" 

### Casual Greetings
Use these for friends or people you are quite familiar with. 

* __Salut__ - "Hi" 
* __Ça va?__ – "How are you?" This is a short form of "Comment Ça va?".
* **Comment vas-tu ?** - Another informal version of "How are you?"

### Responding to "How Are You?"

When someone comes up to you and asks "Comment allez-vous?" or it's more informal forms like "Comment Ça va?" or "Ça va?" you can respond in a variety of ways to express how you are feeling. 

Here are some words to express feelings:

* **bien** - "Well" or "Good"
* **très bien** - "Very well" or "Very good!" 
* **comme ci comme ça** - "So so" 
* **mal** - "Bad" or "not so well"
* **pas mal** - "Not bad"


The formal "Comment allez-vous?" can be reponded with the formula:

> Je vais ____.

So to respond "I'm doing well" would be:

> Je vais bien. 


## Goodbyes

* **Au revoir!** - This is the most common way to say "Goodbye" in French. This is _formal_ and should be recommended for most tourism use.
* **Salut!** - "Goodbye". You may notice, that Salut! is a casual greeting. You can also use this as a "Goodbye" as well. 
* **à bientôt** - "See you soon". While it may mean that you are using it to see someone in the near future, it can also be assumed to be used as a general "Goodbye" as well.
